## Assumptions

* All restaurant names are unique.
* Ratings are integers.
* If two restaurants have the same rating, it doesn't matter which restaurant gets chosen for the meal order.
* There are always enough meals to satisify the meal orders over the restaurant list.

## Things to Note
* If you simply refresh the page, it does not refresh the HTML context and will not work when you run the full example. Please re-run the program if retesting.
